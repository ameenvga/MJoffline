# Keyboard Layouts

Malayala Jalakam supports multiple keyboard layouts for typing in Malayalam. You can switch between these layouts using the keyboard selector in the application.

## Available Layouts

### 1. Phonetic (മലയാളം ഫോണറ്റിക്)

This is the most intuitive layout for English keyboard users. Type Malayalam words as they sound in English.

**Examples:**
- `nannaayirikkunnu` → നന്നായിരിക്കുന്നു
- `malayaalappaaTTa` → മലയാളപ്പാട്ട
- `bhaaratappiiDuka` → ഭാരതപ്പീഡുക

### 2. Inscript (ഇൻസ്ക്രിപ്റ്റ്)

The standard Inscript layout as defined by the Government of India. This is the same layout used in Windows and other operating systems.

**Key Features:**
- Vowels on the left side
- Consonants on the right side
- Special characters for half-forms and chandrakkala

### 3. FML (Fixed Malayalam Layout)

A simplified layout designed for faster typing once learned.

**Key Features:**
- Fixed key assignments
- Logical grouping of related characters
- Efficient for touch typing

## Switching Between Layouts

1. Click on the current keyboard layout indicator in the bottom status bar
2. Select your preferred layout from the dropdown menu
3. The layout will change immediately

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl + Space`: Toggle between English and Malayalam input
- `Alt + Shift + L`: Switch to the next keyboard layout
- `Alt + Shift + K`: Switch to the previous keyboard layout

## Customizing Layouts

Currently, Malayala Jalakam doesn't support custom keyboard layouts. However, you can suggest new layouts or modifications by opening an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ameenvga/MJoffline/issues).

## Tips for Faster Typing

1. Learn the position of common conjuncts (chillaksharam)
2. Use the half-forms (chandrakkala) for combined letters
3. Practice with the on-screen keyboard until you're comfortable with key positions
4. Try different layouts to find which one works best for you

## Troubleshooting

If characters are not appearing as expected:
1. Verify that you've selected the correct keyboard layout
2. Check if Caps Lock is enabled (it can affect character input)
3. Restart the application if the issue persists
